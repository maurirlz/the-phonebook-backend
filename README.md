React frontend with Node.js and express mini-project I made for fullstackopen.com course thanks to Open-University and the University of Helsinki.

In this project I learned all the basics of node as designing and programming an API goes while also integrating my own UI made in React.js with persistence with MongoDB It's a simple ui phonebook where you can directly add your phone and name and It will be saved on my mongo atlas database.

As node goes, with this project I learned:

- MVC design pattern in full
- HTTP requests
- Middleware and designing my own middleware
- Integrating UI with an API
- Deploying said ui and api into a single webpage application in heroku.
- Environment variables and how to save sensitive information in them with .env
- MongoDB modeling with Mongoose and Mongoose unique validator.
- Routing with express.js.
